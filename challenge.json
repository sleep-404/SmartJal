  "usecase_description": "<h1>AI-Based Mapping and Forecasting of Groundwater Levels Using Piezometer Data</h1>\n <p>Developing an AI-driven solution for village-level groundwater mapping, forecasting, and recharge planning using existing piezometer data and aquifer characteristics.</p>\n <p>Theme AI for Water Resource Management</p>\n <p>Department Andhra Pradesh Ground Water and Water Audit Department</p>\n <h2>Challenge Teaser</h2>\n <p>Help Andhra Pradesh safeguard its groundwater resources with AI! Build a system that predicts water levels, identifies recharge needs, and maps aquifer behavior across villages using intelligent analytics.</p>\n <h2>Challenge Overview</h2>\n <p>Groundwater supports nearly 80% of drinking water needs and 60% of agricultural irrigation in Andhra Pradesh. However, decades of over-extraction and unregulated borewell drilling have caused alarming depletion trends. Average groundwater depths have fallen from 4&ndash;6 meters in the 1980s to around 12 meters today, with 56% of wells showing declining levels.<br /> <br /> The Ground Water and Water Audit Department maintains a network of about 1,800 digital water level recorders (piezometers) but lacks AI-enabled forecasting, anomaly detection, and integration with GIS-based planning. This challenge seeks to enhance the existing system using AI and IoT technologies for predictive groundwater management and recharge planning.</p>\n <h2>Expected Solution</h2>\n <p>Participants are invited to develop an AI-enabled groundwater monitoring and forecasting model integrated with the existing piezometer network.</p>\n <p>Key solution features should include:</p>\n <ul>\n <li>AI-Based Groundwater Level Mapping: Assign groundwater level values to villages without piezometers using data from existing sensors and aquifer characteristics.</li>\n <li>Forecasting and Trend Analysis: Predict groundwater depletion using rainfall, extraction rates, and seasonal trends from 1,800+ piezometers.</li>\n <li>Anomaly Detection: Identify abnormal groundwater variations or borewell yield changes with at least 90% precision.</li>\n <li>Recharge Planning: Recommend zones for artificial recharge by identifying critical depletion and protection areas.</li>\n <li>Integration and Visualization: Provide real-time outputs via APIs and dashboards for engineers, scientists, and field officers.</li>\n </ul>\n <h2>Outcomes</h2>\n <ul>\n <li>Real-time, actionable groundwater insights for department officials and engineers.</li>\n <li>Improved efficiency in monitoring and forecasting groundwater trends.</li>\n <li>Direct farmer-level advisories reducing stress and improving recharge efforts.</li>\n <li>Optimized groundwater monitoring and resource management across the state.</li>\n </ul>\n <h2>Expected Impact</h2>\n <ul>\n <li>Sustainability Enables data-driven groundwater budgeting, recharge planning, and drought management.</li>\n <li>Equity &amp; Inclusion Provides early warnings and decision support for farmers and local administrators.</li>\n <li>Policy Alignment Supports National and State Water Policy objectives by enabling enforcement of groundwater protection zones.</li>\n </ul>\n <h2>Dataset Access</h2>\n <ul>\n <li>Piezometer and well IDs with GPS coordinates.</li>\n <li>Historical and real-time groundwater level data.</li>\n <li>Aquifer and geological maps with stratification details.</li>\n <li>Rainfall and climate data for temporal correlation.</li>\n <li>Land-use, recharge structure, irrigation, and extraction datasets for training AI models.</li>\n </ul>\n <h2>Proof of Concept (PoC) Scope</h2>\n <p>The proof-of-concept should be conducted in Krishna District, focusing on a subset of approximately 150 priority piezometers. User testing to include groundwater scientists (15) and district officials (8).</p>\n <h2>Proof of Concept (PoC) Success Criteria</h2>\n <ul>\n <li>At least 70% positive feedback from user testing by department scientists and district officials.</li>\n <li>Demonstrated integration with dashboards and API-based data services.</li>\n </ul>\n <h2>Data Privacy and Compliance</h2>\n <p>Solutions must adhere to data privacy and security norms for hydrological and geospatial data. Any village-level or farmer-related data must be anonymized. The system must ensure explainable and transparent AI outputs for validation and audit purposes.</p>\n ",
